# CLI_POS_Menu_Oracle_SQL
A CLI POS Menu using Oracle SQL Developer.

This project originated as a work for my first year of computer engineering (2023), but I have enjoyed it so much that I started modifying it, adding modularity to achieve cleaner and more maintainable code. Below you can find a list of things I plan to add throughout the year. (They don't have specific dates yet as it has become a side project that has brought me many challenges, good times and learnings about Python.)
  
- Support to run multiple sessions for the cashiers.
- Hope in the near future use django and docker.
- Validate each input according to the type of information expected to be received (currently only validating inputs that require a number type, but the goal is to use regex to validate emails, identification numbers, etc.)
